## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this project being the first one I've completed in a long while, I've learned that I have forgot a lot of what I once knew. I have learned that if I really want to make a career here, I have a long way to go and a lot to relearn. Step one of many completed.

### Continued development

Concepts I need to relearn from this project:

- Flexbox (likly CSS grid as well)
- Complex CSS selectors
- Basic CSS property resets & box-sizing property

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox - CSS-TRICKS](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties) - This reminded me of all the properties associated with flexbox and what they do.
